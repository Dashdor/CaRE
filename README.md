## CaRe: Open Knowledge Graph Embeddings

![](https://github.com/malllabiisc/CaRE/blob/master/CaRe_model.pdf)
*Overview of CaRe (proposed method). CaRe can transform any existing KG embedding model. For any triple (s,r,o), in CaRe, Relation Phrase embeddings are parameterized by encoding vector representations of the word sequence composing them to capture semantic similarity of the phrases. Embeddings of Noun Phrases are made more context rich by updating them with the representations of canonical Noun Phrases.*
