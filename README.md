## CaRe: Open Knowledge Graph Embeddings

*Overview of HyTE (proposed method). a temporally aware
KG embedding method which explicitly incorporates time in the entity-relation space by
stitching each timestamp with a corresponding hyperplane. HyTE not only performs KG
inference using temporal guidance, but also predicts temporal scopes for relational facts with missing time annotations. Please refer paper for more details.*
